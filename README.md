This is a series of activities, Jupyter notebooks, and data 
to support the networked services course in Fall 2022.

# Course Description

This course provides information professionals with skills to thrive in a networked environment. Technical material in the course will be presented in a context that emphasizes its relevance to information professionals. A central theme is programmatic access to open source systems, allowing information institutions to build services beyond their walls. The full course syllabus can be located at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PS3VHIehT6KjKQJZLvBQgGkMXx7TlFT4X8AOB3iZUdw/edit?usp=sharing. 

# Learning Goals
These activities were designed with the intents to:

* Gain confidence in using a non-graphical computer interface (i.e., a text-based command interface to work with local files and those on a remote server);
* Understand how to use web-based services to share metadata (i.e., APIs, OAI-PMH);
* Learn about, explain, and gain confidence in using common data encodings for library/archive/museum (LAM) metadata, including JSON and XML;
* Develop a conceptual understanding of linked data concepts and how they are (or can be) applied in a digital collection environment;
* Conceptualize and design metadata transformations, implement using computational tools (i.e., APIs, Python scripts, and OpenRefine) to extract, transform (crosswalk), and ingest metadata for digital library objects; 
* Create and implement a metadata application profile for a digital collection;
* Find and use resources for keeping up with rapid developments, standards, and new tools or concepts for managing the networked environment and LAM metadata space.

# Structure of the Repository

Most of the materials are at the top level of the repository, which contains a series of notebooks 
structured loosely around: 

* inventorying files and recording technical metadata about files
* using regular expressions (regex)
* working with XML in python, including 
* working with APIs that provide library and archives metadata
* design and implement processes to extract, transform, and load (ETL) metadata from one collection to another

In addition, there are a few specific folders:

* `data` contains sample data for the exercise and activities contained in other folders
* `examples` contains examples of code that is contained in individual files and designed to do specific things
* `in-class-notebooks` contains notebooks or other files that document demonstration sor activities understaken in class
* `assets` contains additional files, such as images or other materials found in the notebooks. 

## Sources

Some of these lessons are based on previous iterations of
my digital curation courses, which were documented at [digccur](https://github.com/morskyjezek/digcur), 
but much is updated.
